# REFLECTION
## Which LLM Did I Use?
I challenged myself to not use AI for this program, but for other programs this semester, I have used a combination of DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT 3.5
## How Has Using LLMs This Semester Helped w/ Programming?
LLMs are very good for effectively looking up library functions (most of the time), but aren't good much past that for Racket (at least the free ones I have used)
## What Additional Skills Do You Need to Use These Tools Effectively
In my opinion, having a good command of the language before even touching an LLM drastically improves what you're able to do with it.  Without that, you're pretty much not learning anything and are just copy/pasting and crossing your fingers that it works
## What is the Big Picture Take-Away?
Overall, I think LLMs, when used properly, can greatly increase your coding productivity.  If you use them improperly, however, you're just doing yourself a disservice as you will replace learning opportunities with copy/pasting
## Advice for Future Students
Don't mindlessly copy/paste from LLMs
